# Create-TRON-LTC-Wallet-Send-Funds.
script in Python that would create a new wallet and send funds to another wallet for the TRON or LTC chain. 
Let's begin by installing the required libraries.

We will need to install the following libraries:

'tronapi' - for interacting with the TRON network
'litecoinutils' - for interacting with the Litecoin network
You can install these libraries using pip, which is a package manager for Python.

' pip install tronapi litecoinutils '


This script will create a new TRON wallet, print the private key and address for the wallet, and create a new LTC transaction with an input and output. You will need to replace the PRIVATE_KEY and ADDRESS with your own values, and the INPUT_TX_HASH and INPUT_TX_INDEX with the input transaction hash and index.
